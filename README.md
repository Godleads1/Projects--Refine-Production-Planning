Analysis Summary

Based on the analysis of the delivery data, here's a summary of the key findings:

Significant Backlog: There is a large backlog of 767 incomplete orders out of a total of 1500, which is a major concern.

Average Delay: The average delay for all orders is about 14.5 minutes, which contributes to the backlog.

Feedback vs. Delays: Orders with positive customer feedback actually have a slightly higher average delay. This suggests that factors other than just delivery time—like customer service or product quality—might be more important for overall satisfaction.

Driver and Route Performance: Specific drivers (D86, D44, and D29) and routes (Route3, Route1, and Route2) have consistently longer delays, indicating they need more attention.

Vehicle Performance: Deliveries made with "Bike C" are slightly slower than those with "Van A," possibly due to limitations in speed or cargo capacity.

Allocation Rules: The "Expedited Rules" system, intended to speed up deliveries, actually results in longer delays compared to "Custom Rules" and "Standard Rules."



Recommendations

To address these issues and improve performance, consider the following actions:

Increase Resources: Add more staff or vehicles, either temporarily or long-term, to clear the backlog and prevent it from growing.

Targeted Training: Provide additional training for drivers with high delays on things like route planning and vehicle maintenance.

Optimize Routes: Re-evaluate high-delay routes by analyzing traffic patterns, delivery times, and other factors to find ways to make them more efficient.

Better Vehicle Allocation: Look at how "Bike C" is being used and consider using it only for shorter or less bulky deliveries.

Improve Allocation Rules: Review the "Expedited Rules" to make them more effective. It might be better to focus on improving the "Custom Rules" since they seem to work well.

Enhance Communication: Improve the way you communicate with customers about their order status and any potential delays to boost customer satisfactio
